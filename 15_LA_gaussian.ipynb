    "\n",
    "Gaussian elimination is the process where one transforms a matrix or linear system through a series of operations into one that is at the very least upper triangular (it is often also presented as including the operation that transforms $A$ completely to diagonal).  These series of operations can be written as a sequence of successive matrix-matrix multiplications by lower triangular matrices.  Letting these matrices be $L_j$ and the resulting upper triangular matrix be $U$ we can write this as\n",
